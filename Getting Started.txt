If you already have a web server running with a SQL server and PHP 7+ feel free to skip to step 2.

1) Install a local development system, for example WAMP. (http://www.wampserver.com/en/)
	It is reccomended you use the 32bit version of WAMP 3.0.6 or higher.
	The high level configuration steps are:
		a)Accept license agreement and continue with the install.
		b)When prompted, select the default browser and notepad (Chrome and Notepad ++ are reccomended)
		c)Run WAMP, it will autoconfigure itself to use localhost as the default domain.
		d)Clone or Copy the content of the github project MT Kestrel to the www directory of WAMP (eg 'C:\wamp\www\MT-Kestrel')
		e)Navigate your default browser to http://localhost/MT-Kestrel/phpversion.php
		f)If current PHP version is not >= 7.0.3 left click on the WAMP icon in the taskbar, select PHP -> version
			then select a version >= 7.0.3.
		g)Reload phpversion.php in your browser, you should now see something like 'Current PHP version: 7.0.10'.
2) Configure SQL (directions are for WAMP, but should be similar with all other SQL systems)
	a)Navigate in your browser to localhost
	b)Click on phpmyadmin
	c)Login to phpmyadmin, by default the username is root with a blank password
	d)Create a new database called 'Kestrel' (or anything you want, you can change it in the config)
	e)Select import and import from file salespoint_schema.sql found in the MT-Kestrel root directory.
	f)Verify there are no errors when tables and indexes are created.
	g)In phpmyadmin, go to user accounts and create a new account called 'web_frontend' and 
		set the password you choose to also set in the project's mt_api/config.php for the user (default: Password_1)
		grant SELECT, INSERT, and UPDATE to web_frontend.
3) Navigate to account registration page of the MT Kestrel application: http://localhost/MT-Kestrel/account_create.php
	a)Create a user account to login an bein using the application at http://localhost/MT-Kestrel/index.php
